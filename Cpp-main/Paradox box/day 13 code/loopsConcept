**Loops in C++**

Loops in C++ are fundamental for repetitive tasks and data iteration. They enable you to execute a block of code multiple times based on a condition. Here are different types of loops, ranging from basic to advanced, along with mnemonic associations:

1. **Level 1 Loops (The Basics):**

    **For Loop (Friends Revisited):**
   - The "for" loop is like inviting your friends over for a fixed number of times.
   - Mnemonic: "Friends are 'for' a fixed time."
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
         // Code to execute for each friend
     }
     ```

    **While Loop (While You Wait):**
   - The "while" loop is like waiting for something to happen while checking a condition.
   - Mnemonic: "Wait 'while' something is true."
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     while (condition) {
         // Code to execute while waiting
     }
     ```

    **Do-While Loop (Do It At Least Once):**
   - The "do-while" loop is like doing something at least once and then checking if you should continue.
   - Mnemonic: "Do it at least once, and 'while' it's true, do it again."
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     do {
         // Code to execute at least once
     } while (condition);
     ```

2. **Level 2 Loops (Intermediate Concepts):**

    **Nested Loops (Lend a Hand Within):**
   - Nested loops are loops within loops, like offering help within help.
   - Mnemonic: "Lend a hand within ('Nested') the task."
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
         for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++) {
             // Code to execute for each combination
         }
     }
     ```

    **Break and Continue (Break or Skip Ahead):**
   - "break" is like breaking out of a loop prematurely, and "continue" is like skipping ahead to the next iteration.
   - Mnemonic: "Break free when needed, or skip ahead to 'continue'."
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
         if (condition) {
             break;     // Break out of the loop
         }
         if (another_condition) {
             continue;  // Skip to the next iteration
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Level 3 Loops (Advanced Techniques):**

    **Range-Based For Loop (Walk Through a Range):**
   - The range-based "for" loop is like walking through a collection of items.
   - Mnemonic: "Walk through a 'range' of items."
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     for (int item : collection) {
         // Code to process each item in the collection
     }
     ```

    **Recursion (Recall and Repeat):**
   - Recursion is like recalling a problem and solving it by breaking it down into smaller, similar problems.
   - Mnemonic: "Recall the problem and 'recur' the solution."
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int factorial(int n) {
         if (n == 0) return 1;
         return n * factorial(n - 1);
     }
     ```

Understanding these loops and their mnemonics will help you master the art of repetition and decision-making in C++ programming, from basic to advanced levels.
